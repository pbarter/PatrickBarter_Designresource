               <p>To help designers both new and in the field have a 
                  website to find various links to resources like fonts and 
                  images and even online tutorials and helpful articles to 
                  expand your creativity.

               <h2>Abobe Fonts</h2>
               <p>Got a Adobe Creative Could subscription? Well you already have access 
                  to thousands of free fonts! What is special about Adobe Fonts is that you 
                  can easily link a font to your website similar to how google fonts has it as 
                  well as add it to your library of fonts to use in your Adobe programs.

               <h2>Google Fonts</h2>
               <p>Great font hosting site in which web designers and developers can link
                  their font of choice to their HTML and CSS and have it show up for visitors 
                  of the website without having to download the font! Can also download fonts 
                  and use them on print work.

               <p>Various media and design projects uploaded by designers both in the 
                  field and in school or practicing to show off their design work. Great 
                  website to find some inspiration. Also has frequent streams of designers 
                  using various Adobe software in design challenges.

               <h2>Webdesign-inspiration</h2>
               <p>A website I discovered near the end of 2018, webdesign-inspiration.com is 
                  a website by one motivated web designer who links various websites that look 
                  appealing. Great way to explore what works, what doesn’t work and to even figure
                  out how a certain designer coded a certain element in their site.

               <h2>Dribble</h2>
               <p>Another inspiration/portfolio website like Behance in which designers can
                  upload work and gain feedback. The only differenceis that Dibble has mostly 
                  smaller projects uploaded like a web page where Behance would have designers 
                  upload a whole website they designed.

               <h2>Lynda</h2>
               <p>A subscription based online tutorial website like Skillshare, what 
                  makes Lynda shine is not only the online tutorials but if you are in a 
                  post secondary school or own a library card, you may be eligable to use 
                  Lynda’s tutorials free!

               <h2>Udemy</h2>
               <p>What makes Udemy stand out is that unlike Lynda and Skillshre in which 
                  you need to subscribe per month, you can just buy the tutorials you want 
                  on Udemy and have access to it forever. You also get an online certificate
                  of completion upon completing the tutorials.
